An honest letter

Dear valued customer,

Thank you for forgetting to cancel your subscription to our service after we decided to sign you up for our trial after buying your personal information from another large reputable tech company. You will now be billed a monthly re-occuring payment too high to be inconsequential, but too low to pop out at you when you review your credit statement.

To cancel your subscription, please find our websight, remember the username and password you used when you signed up with our sister company, navigate a maze of unhelpful account settings pages and possibly find the opt out checkbox that really exists. Really it does. Then, with in three billing cycles we might remember to cancel your subscription.

Sincerly,
Every subsciption service ever
