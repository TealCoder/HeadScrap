# Goofus and Galliant

From highlights magazine. This bit of bitter humor has nothing to do with oppinions I had to hear from my dad about the differences between me and his latest spiritual child.

# On Choosing Fathers
Galliant selects a worthy mentor to serve as his spritual father.
Goofus fails to recognize greatness and puts up with an old coot because of a biological relationship.

## At Work
Galliant competes his way into the most competitive placements at the best tech employers.
Goofus jumps at the first job that lets him live with his mom, with mediocre challenges, compensation and growth potential.

## On Giving Money
Galliant rushes to help unrelated man with gifts of tens of $thousands of financial support.
Goofus won't help out past a few $thousand of "loans" while real father is in desperate times.
BTW, those numbers are as real! Goofus may have gotten a guilt trip, but he still thinks Galliant got scammed.

## On Languages
Galliant is fluent in at least three languages.
Goofus is pretty bad at his only language, despite his family's best efforts to better him.

## At Dad's Funeral
Galliant kneels in somber prayer before the box of remains.
Goofus exclaims "Ew! There's body parts in the house?!"
