# Beer and Chess
So I learned to play chess, if not at least initially from my dad, mostly from him, in my early teen years. Anyway, he always beat me for a few years, even when I practiced with other people.

Any way, one summer, I noticed the more beer he had, the worse he got at chess. In fact, after my dad had 3+ beers, at my current skill level I could beat him! So, I began bringing him a beer the first hint I got that he was ready to start drinking and served a new beer whenever he ran out. I wanted to make sure these beers were nice and cold, to entice him to drink them, so I had to keep an eye on the stock in the fridge.

I was very proud of myself that summer; I frequently beat my dad at chess with this beer-serving move. People implied it wasn't really beating him, but I always defended, in whatever words I would have knonw at that age, that I had in fact mastered the meta-game, outsmarting him at a higher level, and then leveraging that advantage to demonstrate my intellectual superiority through chess.

Later in life it was pointed out to me, that perhaps he felt he had won the meta-game. What would a man do to get a dilligent, attentive, gleeful beer server in his house for free? Surely, losing a few games of chess is a small price. In fact, maybe beer didn't even affect him that much.

Oh well, everyone was happy. Synergy.
