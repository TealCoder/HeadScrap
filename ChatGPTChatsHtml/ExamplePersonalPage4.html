            <span class="section-title">About Me</span>
            <img src="path_to_your_image.jpg" alt="John Doe">
            <p>Originally from Austin, Texas, I've been involved in the tech industry for over 20 years. My journey started with building custom gaming PCs in my garage. It was this initial love for gaming that eventually got me fascinated by machine learning and AI. How do game engines work? What's behind the NPC's decision-making? These questions led me to pursue a career in AI.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working or gaming, you'll find me training for my next marathon. Running offers a kind of meditative solace, a contrast to the fast-paced world of tech and gaming.</p>

            <span class="section-title">Portfolio</span>
            <p>Over the years, I've been a part of various exciting projects. Here's a glimpse:</p>

            <h3>AI Chess Engine</h3>
            <p>Developed a custom chess engine that uses deep learning to predict opponents' moves. This project was inspired by my love for strategy games and a desire to understand game mechanics better.</p>

            <h3>Game Level Designer Tool</h3>
            <p>Built a level designer tool integrated with popular game engines, allowing game developers to create intricate and detailed levels using AI suggestions.</p>

            <span class="section-title">Hobbies & Interests</span>
            <p>Besides my professional interests, I'm a passionate runner. I've completed five marathons, with my personal best being 3 hours and 40 minutes. Gaming is another hobby close to my heart. I've been playing games from classic titles like 'Doom' and 'Quake' to recent ones like 'The Witcher 3' and 'Cyberpunk 2077'.</p>
