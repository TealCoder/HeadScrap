  <p><h1>Friendly Dog Stops Biting</h1></p>
&nbsp;<br>
Once upon a time, in a busy urban area, there was a cute little grey dog named Bamboo. Bamboo loved to play and run around in the parking lot behind his building, but he had a bit of a bad habit of nipping at anyone who came near him. This made his neighbor, Sharon, very nervous and scared to come near Bamboo.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One day, Bamboo's owner, Tiffany, noticed Sharon avoiding the parking lot and asked her what was wrong. Sharon explained that she was scared of Bamboo because he always bit her whenever she tried to pet him. Tiffany was very concerned about this and decided that she needed to help Bamboo break this habit.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tiffany started by spending more time with Bamboo and taking him for regular walks around the neighborhood. She made sure to bring plenty of treats with her and rewarded Bamboo for good behavior. Being more present in Bamboo's life helped him to feel more comfortable and secure.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tiffany also researched different training techniques and learned about positive reinforcement. She started by giving Bamboo treats whenever he didn't nip at anyone. Bamboo soon learned that if he didn't nip, he would get a tasty reward.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Over time, Bamboo learned that nipping was not acceptable and that he could get rewarded for being gentle and friendly. Sharon noticed the change in Bamboo's behavior and started to feel more comfortable around him. She even began to pet him and play with him in the parking lot.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Bamboo was thrilled to have a new friend in Sharon and made sure to always be on his best behavior around her. He continued to be a playful and energetic pup, but he learned that he could still be friendly and gentle at the same time.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
From that day forward, Bamboo was known as the friendliest dog in the building, and Sharon became one of his biggest fans. Bamboo was happy to have learned a valuable lesson and even happier to have made a new friend in the process.<br>
