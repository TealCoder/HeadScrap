  <p><h1>My thoughts about these pages</h1></p>
&nbsp;<br>
Not a chat, just my inner debate as I resisted putting these things online. Then some other thoughts I had.<br>
<h2>Sean</h2>You're polluting the internet!<h2>Sean</h2>Maybe not? Text is a terribly inexpensive thing to store. Currently the main way I find text to read is through search and these snippets are a lot better than most of the SEOed, ad-ladden atrocities I normally land in. I think that in 20 years the primary way to interact with text will be with the next generation of LLMs which will benifit people like me greatly if there are concise answers to all our questions in the training data; i.e. when these, as part of the internet, are added to the training data of those LLMs.<h2>Sean</h2>With the thought that I'll be using AI to make sense of all my data in the near future, I've begun hoarding <em>everything</em> digital. Some things I even put online in hopes it'll be useful for future users.<br>
