Title: AITA for calling off the wedding because my fiancé never blinks?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Hello, Reddit. This is gonna sound really strange and trust me, I've been struggling with it for weeks. I've been with my fiancé, Daniel, for 2 years now. Our wedding is scheduled in 3 months. I love him with all my heart, and he's been nothing but amazing. But there's something about him that's always bugged me and I can't shake it off.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
He. Never. Blinks.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I first noticed it when we went to the movies on our third date. I thought he was just engrossed in the film, but then it continued during dinner, and ever since. He insists it's just a weird genetic thing and his eyes don't dry out. He's shown me medical records and even had an ophthalmologist explain it to me.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But it's more than the blinking. I started watching closely, and there are other "normal" human habits he just doesn't do. He doesn't sneeze. He doesn't yawn. The man does not hiccup. Ever.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
At night, I sometimes just stare at him, hoping to catch him in one spontaneous act, but nothing. It gives me chills and I can't shake the feeling that something is off.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I brought this up with my best friend, and she thinks I'm overreacting and shouldn't judge him for something he can't control. But last week, I had a vivid nightmare where everyone in the world, including me, were blinking normally and he was the only one standing still, not blinking, not moving. It terrified me.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I'm now considering calling off the wedding. Not breaking up, just postponing it until I can come to terms with this or find a logical explanation that satisfies me.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Reddit, AITA for wanting to call off a wedding for such a bizarre reason?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TL;DR: Fiancé never blinks or does other "normal" involuntary human habits. It's freaking me out and I'm considering calling off the wedding. AITA?<br>
